In my spare time, I like to compose music. You can check my music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6wWv9SWI07KvCb9YTNJFpa?si=QDW-VkW6QuKi_b2RUyxBxw) or [Apple music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/uncle-pores/1719448357).

The genre of my music is mostly pop folk and Indie. I learnt Indian classical music for a long time, so I also make fusion electronic music with Indian classical instruments. I generally use open-source AI softwares to help me in the composition and the vocals.

Some of my representative albums are below.
