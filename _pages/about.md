Hey there! Excited to have your here.

I am a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) Ph.D fellow jointly enrolled at the Department of Computing Science, University of Verona, Italy (UNIVR) and at the Automatic Control, Robotics and Computer Vision division at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) Barcelona, Spain. My thesis is jointly supervised by [Prof. Paolo Fiorini](https://profs.sci.univr.it/~fiorini/) and [Prof Alicia Casals](https://futur.upc.edu/AliciaCasalsGelpi). This Ph.D. journey is a part of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, AuTonomous intraLumiAl Surgery [ATLAS](https://atlas-itn.eu/) project.


My research focuses on algorithms that can enable autonomous agents to learn complex behaviors through trial and error, particularly applied to **surgical robots**.
<!-- My research interest includes developing **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** methods for robotics application with specific emphasis on **surgical robots**.  -->
Surgical robots offer a safety critical paradigm that require robust and adaptible control. The developed algorithms are tested in virtual simulation environments as well as real robotic platforms.

An essential part of my work has been towards learning effective task representations that could help in generalising policies to other tasks.
For detailed list of my research activity, visit the [publications page](https://ameyapores.github.io/publications/).
